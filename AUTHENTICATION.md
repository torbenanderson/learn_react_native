# Authentication in React Native 🔐

Authentication is a critical part of most mobile applications, and in the React Native ecosystem, people typically use a mix of third-party services, dedicated libraries, and custom solutions. The choice often depends on the project's complexity, team size, and budget.

Here are the most common and popular authentication methods used by React Native developers:

## 1. Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) Solutions

These are the most popular and recommended options for most applications because they handle a huge amount of the complexity for you, including user management, secure password storage, and various login methods.

### **Firebase Authentication**
This is arguably the most popular choice, especially for new projects and startups.

**Features:** It provides a comprehensive set of easy-to-use SDKs for authenticating users via email/password, phone numbers, and social providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

**Pros:** Very quick to set up, generous free tier, and seamless integration with other Firebase services like Firestore (database) and Cloud Functions.

**Cons:** Can be difficult to integrate with a custom backend outside of the Firebase ecosystem.

### **AWS Amplify**
A great choice for teams already in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem.

**Features:** It provides an integrated SDK for building authenticated apps. It connects to services like Amazon Cognito for user pools and Identity and Access Management (IAM).

**Pros:** Deep integration with other AWS services, highly scalable, and gives you more control over the backend.

**Cons:** Can have a steeper learning curve than Firebase.

### **Auth0 / Clerk**
These are dedicated identity management platforms.

**Features:** They offer a highly customizable and secure authentication system with a focus on enterprise-grade features like Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and a wide array of social login options.

**Pros:** Extremely powerful and flexible, excellent for complex or enterprise applications, and supports a massive range of authentication flows.

**Cons:** Can be more expensive than Firebase's free tier as you scale.

## 2. Custom Backend with Token-Based Authentication

For projects with a pre-existing or custom-built backend, the most common approach is to use **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**.

### **How it Works:**

1. The user sends their credentials (username/password) to your custom backend.
2. The backend verifies the credentials and, if successful, generates a JWT.
3. The backend sends this JWT back to the React Native app.
4. The app securely stores this JWT on the device (e.g., using `expo-secure-store` or `react-native-keychain`).
5. For every subsequent request to a protected endpoint, the app includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
6. The backend validates the JWT to ensure the user is authenticated.

**Pros:** Gives you full control over your backend and authentication flow.

**Cons:** Requires you to build and maintain the entire authentication logic on your backend, including secure password hashing, token generation, and validation.

## 3. Social and Passwordless Authentication

Many apps don't rely solely on traditional email/password logins.

### **Social Logins (OAuth)**
Users can log in using their accounts from Google, Facebook, Apple, and other services. This is very popular for improving the user experience and reducing friction. Libraries like `expo-auth-session` and `react-native-google-signin` make this straightforward.

### **Phone Number Authentication**
This is a popular passwordless method, often handled by services like Firebase. It uses a one-time code sent via SMS to verify the user's identity.

### **Biometric Authentication**
React Native supports local authentication using `expo-local-authentication` to use the device's biometrics (Face ID or fingerprint) to verify a user who is already logged in.

## Best Practices for Handling Authentication in React Native

Regardless of the method you choose, here are some essential best practices:

### **Secure Storage**
Never store sensitive information like JWTs, API keys, or passwords in plain text on the device. Use secure storage solutions like `expo-secure-store` (for Expo projects) or `react-native-keychain` (for bare React Native projects).

### **Context API**
Use React's Context API to manage the user's authentication state throughout your application. This makes it easy to know if a user is logged in and to share their information with any component that needs it.

### **Protect Routes**
Create an authentication flow with a "loading" screen that checks the user's stored token on app launch. If a token exists and is valid, navigate to the main app; otherwise, navigate to the login screen. This is often handled by navigation libraries like `react-navigation` and `expo-router`.

### **Use HTTPS**
All API calls should be made over HTTPS to prevent "man-in-the-middle" attacks where an attacker could intercept unencrypted user data.

## Implementation Examples

### **Firebase Authentication Setup**
```typescript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth, signInWithEmailAndPassword } from 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your Firebase config
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);

// Sign in with email and password
const signIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    const user = userCredential.user;
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sign in error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### **JWT Token Management**
```typescript
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

// Store JWT token
const storeToken = async (token: string) => {
  await SecureStore.setItemAsync('userToken', token);
};

// Retrieve JWT token
const getToken = async () => {
  return await SecureStore.getItemAsync('userToken');
};

// Remove JWT token
const removeToken = async () => {
  await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('userToken');
};
```

### **Authentication Context**
```typescript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface AuthContextType {
  user: any | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  signIn: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  signOut: () => Promise<void>;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export const AuthProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<any | null>(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check for existing token on app launch
    checkAuthState();
  }, []);

  const checkAuthState = async () => {
    try {
      const token = await getToken();
      if (token) {
        // Validate token with backend
        const userData = await validateToken(token);
        setUser(userData);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Auth check failed:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  const signIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
    // Implement sign in logic
  };

  const signOut = async () => {
    await removeToken();
    setUser(null);
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, isLoading, signIn, signOut }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```
